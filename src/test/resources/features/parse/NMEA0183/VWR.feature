@NMEA0183
@Parse

Feature: 
    As a vessel operator using a wind instrument that transmits NMEA0183 sentences 
    I want to have VWR (Relative Wind Speed and Angle) messages parsed correctly 
    So that I can trim sails properly and maintain the correct wind angle

    Background:
        Given this NMEA0183 sentence from an instrument: ""
        

    @WindDirection
    @WindSpeed
    Scenario: Parse a VWR sentence
        When the NMEA0183 sentence is parsed
        Then wind direction is returned
        And wind speed is returned

    @WindDirection
    Scenario: Parse wind direction from a VWR sentence
        When the NMEA0183 sentence is parsed
        Then this wind direction is returned:
            | wind direction | 20Â° starboard |
            | source         | NMEA0183      |

    @WindSpeed
    Scenario: Parse wind speed from a VWR sentence
        When the NMEA0183 sentence is parsed
        Then this wind speed is returned:
            | wind speed | 20 knots |
            | source     | NMEA0183 |
